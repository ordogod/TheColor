## What is it

This is a native Android application about colors.
You can search for a specific color or generate a random one.
Explore detailed color information and create custom color schemes with the color scheme builder.

The app is powered by [The Color API](https://github.com/joshbeckman/thecolorapi).
For a full list of features, check out the [App Features](#app-features) section.

## Who is it for

This project showcases my expertise in developing software in general and
native Android apps in specific.
Originally, it served as a playground, a safe environment to try new things in Android world.
Over the course of years, it evolved into a polished, comprehensive app that I'm proud to share.

I would be flattered if other developers find inspiration in this software, its approaches and 
solutions.
It has open-source code and full commit history, so anyone can trace my decisions and the app's development journey.

## App Features

### Home
The main screen of the app. Displayed after the Splash screen.
Contains *Color Input*, *Color Preview* and *Color Center* features (views).  They are always in sync:

 - entering a valid color in *Color Input* will show *Color Preview* for it.
 - changing or clearing *Color Input* will change / hide *Color Preview*.
 - generating a new random color will populate it into *Color Input*.
 - selecting "go to exact color" or "go to initial color" in *Color Details* will populate *Color Input* with the corresponding color.

Allows to go to the *Settings* screen.
Allows to proceed with the current color. This will fetch data regarding the color and display *Color Center*.
Allows to generate a random color.

Handles keyboard "done" button click of *Color Input*. 
When there's a valid color, the app will proceed with it and a software keyboard (if any) will be hidden. If the color is not valid, then a message will be shown and a software keyboard will remain visible, allowing user to correct the input.

*Color Center* is displayed when a color is proceeded with, hidden when color is changed (but not proceeded with yet) or cleared.
*Color Center* is fully recreated when a color is proceeded with. 
This means that any user input that happened for previous color will be reset to default values (e.g. color scheme mode in *Color Scheme*).

Selecting a swatch in *Color Scheme* displays *Color Details* for this color.

If *"resume from last searched color"* feature from *Settings* is enabled, then the last searched (proceeded with) color will be proceeded with on app startup.

If *"auto proceed with randomized colors"* feature from *Settings* is enabled, then generating a new random color will instantly proceed with it.

### Color Input
Allows user to enter a color in a chosen color space.
Consists of a view for user input and a list of color spaces to choose from.

All color input types are synchronized. 
If user enters a valid color through color input of color space X, then when switching to color space Y they will see the same color. If user clears input in any color input type, all color inputs are cleared.

User can change a preferred type of color input on the *Settings* screen. The chosen type will become the first one in the list of available color input types. The chosen type will be selected on app launch.

Supports *"smart backspace"* and *"select all text on focus"* features from *Settings*.

### Color Preview
A small view that visually displays a color.

### Color Center
A group of two other feature: *Color Details* and *Color Scheme*.

### Color Details
Presents information about a color: 
 - color name
 - translations to different color spaces
 - whether the color is an exact match or not
 - color of the exact match
 - deviation from the exact match

Allows to go to the exact match and view its info.
Allows to go back to the initial color after that.

### Color Scheme
Consists of two parts: color scheme with swatches and color scheme builder. 
List of the swatches has the current color (one that was proceeded with) as a seed. Other parameters of color scheme are configured from the builder.

Allows to choose the mode of the color scheme: monochrome, analogic, etc.
Allows to choose number of swatches to have in the color scheme.

### Settings
Contains items with values. Changing values will change the behaviour of the parts of the app those items relate to.
Allows user to reset their preferences back to default values.

Settings items are listed below.

#### Preferred type of color input
Allows to select a type of color input to be selected by default (on app startup) in *Color Input*. This type will also be the first in the list of available input types.

#### UI theme
A color scheme of the application. The options are:

 - Light, always, irregarding of device's Dark mode setting.
 - Dark, always, irregarding of device's Dark mode setting.
 - Auto. Resolves into either Light or Dark depending on the device's Dark mode setting.

#### Resume from last searched color
On app startup, the *Home* screen will remember the last color that was proceeded with in the previous app session. This color will be automatically proceeded with.

#### Smart backspace
Go to previous text field when clicking "backspace" in an empty text field. 
Enables easier editing in text fields of *Color Input*. On Android, there's a "next" button on software keyboard. It allows to go to the next text field in order to not waste time reaching to it (next text field) manually. This feature allows to go to the previous text field by clicking "backspace" when the text field is already empty.

#### Select all text on focus
Select all text in a text field when it gets focused (e.g. when user clicks it). 
This feature makes it quicker to change the entire value of the text field. With the text pre-selected, there's no need to manually clear itâ€”simply start typing, and the new input will instantly replace the existing text.

#### Auto proceed with randomized colors
Generating a new random color on *Home* screen will automatically proceed with it.

## Software approaches

### Clean Architecture
Clean architecture straight from Robert Martin's book. The app has 3 layers: domain, data and presentation. Domain layer is the most important and sensitive one, thus it's the most high-level and doesn't depend on other layers. Data layer retrieves and stores data used by domain layer. Presentation layer contains user interface (GUI in particular).

There are some curious places in the code architecture-wise, like accessing `Repositories` directly from Presentation and implementing use cases in Data layer. I'm giving you the opportunity to find them in code and make sense of them yourself. Documentation and commit history will help you with it.

### Gradle modularization
Each feature or themed clump of code is located in its own Gradle module. This allows to easier trace dependencies between parts of the codebase and restricts access to things that should not be accessed in a particular context. Also improves build time and project structure.

### Single `Activity` approach 
Activities in Android are somewhat expensive to create in terms of processing power. That's why it is recommended to have only one `Activity` that will house all UI of the app.

### Event-Command approach
Allows to create highly reusable features and components. Introduces terms *Event* and *Command*.

*Event* is something that originates inside component (feature) and is destined to be broadcast to the outside (hosting components: clients). An example of the event in the app is selecting a color swatch in *Color Scheme* feature. When the *Color Scheme* is located on *Home* screen, it will open a *Color Details* dialog for the selected color. The *Home* screen decides how to react to the event of selecting a color swatch. This allows to define any behaviour depending on the context where *Color Scheme* is used. For example, in other place selecting a color swatch will open a web browser.

*Command* originates in the outside of the component and destined to be processed (handled, executed, reacted to) by the component itself. An example of the command in the app is fetching data in *Color Details* once the color is proceeded with. *Home* screen sends a command "fetch data for this color" to *Color Details*, and the latter obeys.

### Platform-agnostic `ViewModel`s
Platform-agnostic ViewModels, free from Android SDK and UI framework dependencies, improve reusability, testability, and maintainability. 

Decoupling from Android SDK significantly simplifies unit tests, removing the need to have Robolectric to recreate components like `Context` that are present only on real devices.

Freeing from dependencies of specific UI framework keeps ViewModels more stable and protected from changes in the future. Opting in for using Kotlin `Flow` instead of `State` from Jetpack Compose will save your ViewModels from changes if one day you decide to change a UI framework.

Exposing platform-agnostic models from ViewModels enables latter to be used in UI implemented with any framework.


### Valuable unit tests
For me, unit tests are the must-have thing if you are serious about the work you're doing and the results you're trying to achieve.
I have a list of rules when it comes to unit tests. This allows me to have only unit tests that are indeed valuable.

I **only** write (or add new) unit tests if:
 - a piece of code was caught containing a bug
 - a piece of code may be executed in a multitude of ways and yield different results / produce various side-effects
 - a piece of code is vital for the application
 - a piece of code employs API that I'm not entirely sure how it works

When writing a new unit test, I try to put it next to other tests that target the same feature of the component.
Most of the times I have only one assertion in the test. 
I add verbose documentation for tests that have complex *given* or/and *when* parts.
I keep most of mocked behaviour in the body of each test case. I rarely mock dependencies outside of the particular test.
I almost never use visibility modifiers in unit test classes.
